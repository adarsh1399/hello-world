Hi Lets solve confilct by git pull

Follow the following steps

git pull
error: Your local changes to the following files 

first add and commit the conflict files

then run git pull command
git pull

now it shows like
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

Now open the conflict file and solve the conflicts manually there

After solving conflicts save the file and come back to git bash

now again add and commit the solved the file 

Now you can check git status ,
It shows working tree is clean

then git push

Note :- We did two commits here ,So if we follow this step,In commits tab in remote you see two commits for this one push
