Some git commands to help you for tes 
it commands to help you for local add

Let suppose there are two developers working on the same file A.txt in same branch.
Firstly developer 1 made some changes in local in A.txt and push it to the remote
Now the developer 2 needs this changes but he has some changes in A.txt.

while git pull you are getting error of merge conflict

So How Developer 2 takes remote code ?

Try this command

git stash // save your local work somewhere and point to the last commit of git pull

git pull //takes the remote changes  

git stash apply // so now it shows the merge conflict and auto merging is failed

Now Go to the Conflict file 

<<<<<<<
=======
>>>>>>>

you see this things in a file where a conflicts occur

Now solve the confilct manually in file

After solving conflict manually,then 

git add A.txt

git stash

git pull

git stash pop

------------------------

now check git status 

A.txt comes in red color under Changes not stagged for commit

now add 

git add A.txt

git commit -m "solve merge conflict"

git push

I hope it solved your problem.
