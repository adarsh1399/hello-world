record keyword

A record is a special type of class declaraton aimed at reducing the boilerplate code.Record is added as a preview feature(Preview feature means it may or may not be present in future).A record is a restricted form of a class. It's ideal for "plain data carriers" , means for the classes that contain data not meant to be altered.It is introduced in jdk 14.0.

for example:- Consider  a Student class ,whose objective is to conatin Student's name and doteOFBirth and act as a data carrier to be transeferred across modules.

// Without using record keyword
class Student
{
	final String name
	final String dateOfBirth

	public Strudent(String name,String dateOfBirth)
	{
		this.name=name;
		this.ateOfBirth=dateOfBirth;
	}

	public boolean equals(Object object)
	{
		//Implementation f equals method here
	}

	public Sting toString()
	{
		//Implementation of toString method here
	}
}

//Using record keyword
public record Stundent(String name,String dateOfBirth)

1  line can reduce lots of boilerplate code .

A record acquires these members automatically :-

1.A private final field for each of its components
2.A public constructor whose signature is derived from the record components list
3.Implementations of the  equals() , hashCode() and toString()
4.A public read accessors method for each component with same name and type()


How to use record keyword:-

Download jdk 14.0 first.Add it in IDE.As it is a preview feature , we need to enable them to use it in IDE.You can enable it by project Exploerer(right click on project) -> Properties -> Java Complier -> on left side, uncheck the settings with name 
1."Use default compliance settings" 
2. "Use compliance from execution environment 'JavaSE-14' on Java BUild PATH " and checked the settings with name 
1."enable preview features for java 14"

Now yo are able to use it.
